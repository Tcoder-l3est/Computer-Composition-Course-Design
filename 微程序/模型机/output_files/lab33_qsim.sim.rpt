Info (310003): Option to preserve fewer signal transitions to reduce memory requirements is enabled
    Info (310004): Simulation has been partitioned into sub-simulations according to the maximum transition count determined by the engine. Transitions from memory will be flushed out to disk at the end of each sub-simulation to reduce memory requirements.
Info (310002): Simulation partitioned into 1 sub-simulations
Info (328053): Simulation coverage is       0.00 %
Info (328052): Number of transitions in simulation is 0
Info (324045): Vector file lab33_qsim.sim.vwf is saved in VWF text format. You can compress it into CVWF format in order to reduce file size. For more details please refer to the Quartus II Help.
